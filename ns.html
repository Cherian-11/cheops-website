    <p>
        Chandrayaan-3 was launched on 14 July 2023, at 2:35 pm IST as scheduled,
         from Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India.
          The spacecraft has been effectively placed in the trajectory it will take to reach the moon.
          <br>
          <br>
          Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a 
          Rover with an objective of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. 
          The Lander will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the 
          Rover which will carry out in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. 
          The Lander and the Rover have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. 
          The main function of PM is to carry the LM from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from PM.
           Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be operated post separation of Lander Module.
           The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is GSLV-Mk3 which will place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.
