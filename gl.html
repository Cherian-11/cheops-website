    <h1>GALAXY</h1>
    <p>
        A galaxy is a system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter bound together by gravity.The word is derived from the Greek galaxias , literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that contains the Solar System. 
        Galaxies, averaging an estimated 100 million stars, range in size from dwarfs with less than a hundred million stars, to the largest galaxies known – supergiants with one hundred trillion stars,each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. 
        Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the centres of galaxies.
    <br>
    <br>
        Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,spiral, or irregular.Many are thought to have supermassive black holes at their centers. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant galaxy observed.
         It has a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and is seen as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang.
    <br>
    <br>    
        It is estimated that there are roughly 200 billion galaxies (2×1011) in the observable universe.Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 300,000 light years) and are separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). 
        <br>
        <br>
        The space between galaxies is filled with a tenuous gas (the intergalactic medium) with an average density of less than one atom per cubic meter. Most galaxies are gravitationally organized into groups, clusters and superclusters.
         The Milky Way is part of the Local Group, which it dominates along with Andromeda Galaxy.
